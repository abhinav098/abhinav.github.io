  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <p>Hi, I'm Abhinav Garg, from Chandigarh, India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    I'm a full stack engineer with a passion for building software products. I
    did my undergrad from Kurukshetra University with a major in electronics and
    communication but my sheer interest in computers lead me to becoming a
    self-taught engineer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started my professional career as an automation test engineer, wrote some
    testing scripts for one of the projects at MindNudge. Later I got fascinated
    by the way websites are designed and the technologies involved for the
    development of websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started learning Ruby on Rails and JavaScript to begin with my website
    development career. It's been more than 3 years now, I have developed a
    number of websites and worked on 8 professional projects of varying
    complexity. I aim to become a CTO in long run.
