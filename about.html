      <p>Hi, I'm Abhinav Garg, from Chandigarh, India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³</p>
      <p>
        I'm a full stack engineer with a passion for building software products.
        I did my undergrad from Kurukshetra University with a major in
        electronics and communication but my sheer interest in computers lead me
        to becoming a self-taught engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my professional career as an automation test engineer, wrote
        some testing scripts for one of the projects at MindNudge. Later I got
        fascinated by the way websites are designed and the technologies
        involved for the development of websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started learning Ruby on Rails and JavaScript to begin with my website
        development career. It's been more than 3 years now, I have developed a
        number of websites and worked on 8 professional projects of varying
        complexity. I aim to become a CTO in long run.
